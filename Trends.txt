When measured by "Overall Passing Rate", "Charter" type schools outperform "District" type schools. "Overall Passing Rate" is determined by averaging the percentage of students who passed math and reading. Although you may expect Charter type schools to have more budget spending per student to obtain these exceptional results, this is not the case. The worst performing District type schools spend 15-20% more (about $75-100) per student and still have a lower overall passing rate. It should be noted that the difference in passing rate isn't massive, but does differ by about 23%.

Interestingly, in the overall scheme of things, test scores actually trend downward when more budget money per student is increased. This is also the case when student body size increases. Although unexamined directly in this analysis, the data suggests that a larger student body correlates with an overall lower passing rate. If true, this would help explain why Charter type schools outperform District type schools significantly, as District type schools have anywhere from 1000-4000 more students enrolled. This could also help explain why more money per student doesn't necessarily increase scores, as Charter type schools naturally have smaller student populations and thus more money to spend per student.

Further data analysis on a possible correlation between student body size and overall test performance would be an excellent direction to take this project further in the future.
